<dd>Mahalo, &quot;...the world's first human-powered search engine&quot;. All the markup
    that powers the wiki is stored in HBase. It's been in use for a few months now.
    MediaWiki - the same software that power Wikipedia - has version/revision control.
    Mahalo's in-house editors produce a lot of revisions per day, which was not
    working well in a RDBMS. An hbase-based solution for this was built and tested,
    and the data migrated out of MySQL and into HBase. Right now it's at something
    like 6 million items in HBase. The upload tool runs every hour from a shell
    script to back up that data, and on 6 nodes takes about 5-10 minutes to run -
    and does not slow down production at all.</dd>

    aspects of our backend - user and resume data storage, analytics processing,
    machine learning algorithms for our job recommendation engine. Our live
    production site is directly served from HBase. We use cascading for running
    offline data processing jobs.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.runa.com/">Runa Inc.</a></dt>
  
<dd>Runa Inc. offers a SaaS that enables online merchants to offer dynamic
    per-consumer, per-product promotions embedded in their website. To implement
    this we collect the click streams of all their visitors to determine along
    with the rules of the merchant what promotion to offer the visitor at different
    points of their browsing the Merchant website. So we have lots of data and have
    to do lots of off-line and real-time analytics. HBase is the core for us.
    We also use Clojure and our own open sourced distributed processing framework,
    Swarmiji. The HBase Community has been key to our forward movement with HBase.
    We're looking for experienced developers to join us to help make things go even
    faster!</dd>

<dd>Sematext runs
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sematext.com/search-analytics/index.html">Search Analytics</a>,
    a service that uses HBase to store search activity and MapReduce to produce
    reports showing user search behaviour and experience. Sematext runs
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sematext.com/spm/index.html">Scalable Performance Monitoring (SPM)</a>,
    a service that uses HBase to store performance data over time, crunch it with
    the help of MapReduce, and display it in a visually rich browser-based UI.
    Interestingly, SPM features
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.sematext.com/spm/hbase-performance-monitoring/index.html">SPM for HBase</a>,
    which is specifically designed to monitor all HBase performance metrics.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.socialmedia.com/">SocialMedia</a></dt>
  
<dd>SocialMedia uses HBase to store and process user events which allows us to
    provide near-realtime user metrics and reporting. HBase forms the heart of
    our Advertising Network data storage and management system. We use HBase as
    a data source and sink for both realtime request cycle queries and as a
    backend for mapreduce analysis.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.splicemachine.com/">Splice Machine</a></dt>
  
<dd>Splice Machine is built on top of HBase.  Splice Machine is a full-featured

    transactions, optimized joins, triggers, and UDFs.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.streamy.com/">Streamy</a></dt>
  
<dd>Streamy is a recently launched realtime social news site.  We use HBase
    for all of our data storage, query, and analysis needs, replacing an existing
    SQL-based system.  This includes hundreds of millions of documents, sparse
    matrices, logs, and everything else once done in the relational system. We
    perform significant in-memory caching of query results similar to a traditional
    Memcached/SQL setup as well as other external components to perform joining
    and sorting.  We also run thousands of daily MapReduce jobs using HBase tables
    for log analysis, attention data processing, and feed crawling.  HBase has
    helped us scale and distribute in ways we could not otherwise, and the
    community has provided consistent and invaluable assistance.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/">Stumbleupon</a></dt>
  
<dd>Stumbleupon and <a class="externalLink" href="http://su.pr">Su.pr</a> use HBase as a real time
    data storage and analytics platform. Serving directly out of HBase, various site
    features and statistics are kept up to date in a real time fashion. We also
    use HBase a map-reduce data source to overcome traditional query speed limits
    in MySQL.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.tokenizer.org">Shopping Engine at Tokenizer</a></dt>
  
<dd>Shopping Engine at Tokenizer is a web crawler; it uses HBase to store URLs
    and Outlinks (AnchorText + LinkedURL): more than a billion. It was initially
    designed as Nutch-Hadoop extension, then (due to very specific 'shopping'
    scenario) moved to SOLR + MySQL(InnoDB) (ten thousands queries per second),
    and now - to HBase. HBase is significantly faster due to: no need for huge
    transaction logs, column-oriented design exactly matches 'lazy' business logic,
    data compression, !MapReduce support. Number of mutable 'indexes' (term from
    RDBMS) significantly reduced due to the fact that each 'row::column' structure
    is physically sorted by 'row'. MySQL InnoDB engine is best DB choice for
    highly-concurrent updates. However, necessity to flash a block of data to
    harddrive even if we changed only few bytes is obvious bottleneck. HBase
    greatly helps: not-so-popular in modern DBMS 'delete-insert', 'mutable primary
    key', and 'natural primary key' patterns become a big advantage with HBase.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://traackr.com/">Traackr</a></dt>
  
<dd>Traackr uses HBase to store and serve online influencer data in real-time.
    We use MapReduce to frequently re-score our entire data set as we keep updating
    influencer metrics on a daily basis.</dd>

<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://trendmicro.com/">Trend Micro</a></dt>
  
<dd>Trend Micro uses HBase as a foundation for cloud scale storage for a variety
    of applications. We have been developing with HBase since version 0.1 and
    production since version 0.20.0.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a></dt>
  
<dd>Twitter runs HBase across its entire Hadoop cluster. HBase provides a
    distributed, read/write backup of all  mysql tables in Twitter's production
    backend, allowing engineers to run MapReduce jobs over the data while maintaining
    the ability to apply periodic row updates (something that is more difficult
    to do with vanilla HDFS).  A number of applications including people search
    rely on HBase internally for data generation. Additionally, the operations
    team uses HBase as a timeseries database for cluster-wide monitoring/performance
    data.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.udanax.org">Udanax.org</a></dt>
  
<dd>Udanax.org is a URL shortener which use 10 nodes HBase cluster to store URLs,
    Web Log data and response the real-time request on its Web Server. This
    application is now used for some twitter clients and a number of web sites.
    Currently API requests are almost 30 per second and web redirection requests
    are about 300 per second.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.veoh.com/">Veoh Networks</a></dt>
  
<dd>Veoh Networks uses HBase to store and process visitor (human) and entity
    (non-human) profiles which are used for behavioral targeting, demographic
    detection, and personalization services.  Our site reads this data in
    real-time (heavily cached) and submits updates via various batch map/reduce
    jobs. With 25 million unique visitors a month storing this data in a traditional
    RDBMS is not an option. We currently have a 24 node Hadoop/HBase cluster and
    our profiling system is sharing this cluster with our other Hadoop data
    pipeline processes.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.videosurf.com/">VideoSurf</a></dt>
  
<dd>VideoSurf - &quot;The video search engine that has taught computers to see&quot;.
    We're using HBase to persist various large graphs of data and other statistics.
    HBase was a real win for us because it let us store substantially larger
    datasets without the need for manually partitioning the data and its
    column-oriented nature allowed us to create schemas that were substantially
    more efficient for storing and retrieving data.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.visibletechnologies.com/">Visible Technologies</a></dt>
  
<dd>Visible Technologies uses Hadoop, HBase, Katta, and more to collect, parse,
    store, and search hundreds of millions of Social Media content. We get incredibly
    fast throughput and very low latency on commodity hardware. HBase enables our
    business to exist.</dd>

  
<dt><a class="externalLink" href="http://www.worldlingo.com/">WorldLingo</a></dt>
  
<dd>The WorldLingo Multilingual Archive. We use HBase to store millions of
    documents that we scan using Map/Reduce jobs to machine translate them into
    all or selected target languages from our set of available machine translation
    languages. We currently store 12 million documents but plan to eventually
    reach the 450 million mark. HBase allows us to scale out as we need to grow
    our storage capacities. Combined with Hadoop to keep the data replicated and
    therefore fail-safe we have the backbone our service can rely on now and in
    the future. !WorldLingo is using HBase since December 2007 and is along with
    a few others one of the longest running HBase installation. Currently we are
    running the latest HBase 0.20 and serving directly from it at
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.worldlingo.com/ma/enwiki/en/HBase">MultilingualArchive</a>.</dd>
